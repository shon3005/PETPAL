        // For binding to the likes of a post we use the observe method. The observe method is provided by the Bond framework and can be called on any object wrapped in the Observable type. The observe method takes one parameter, a closure (defined as a trailing closure in the code above), which in our case has type [PFUser]? -> (). The code defined by the closure will be executed whenever post.image receives a new value. The constant named value in the closure definition will contain the actual contents of post.likes, that is, the Observable wrapper will have been removed.
        likeDisposable = post.likes.observe { (value: [PFUser]?) -> () in

            // If we have received a value, we perform different updates. First of all we update the likesLabel to display a list of usernames of all users that have liked the post. We use a utility method stringFromUserList to generate that list. We'll add and discuss that method later on!

If the user has liked the post, we want the button to be in the Selected state so that the heart appears red. If not selected will be set to false and the heart will be displayed in gray.
