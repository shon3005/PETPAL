// 1 To create a custom Parse class you need to inherit from PFObject and implement the PFSubclassing protocol
class Post : PFObject, PFSubclassing {
  
  var photoUploadTask: UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier?
  var image: Observable<UIImage?> = Observable(nil)
  
  // 2 Next, define each property that you want to access on this Parse class. For our Post class that's the user and the imageFile of a post. That will allow you to change the code that accesses properties through strings: post["imageFile"] = imageFile Into code that uses Swift properties: post.imageFile = imageFile
  @NSManaged var imageFile: PFFile?
  @NSManaged var user: PFUser?
  
  
  //MARK: PFSubclassing Protocol
  
  // 3 By implementing the parseClassName you create a connection between the Parse class and your Swift class.

      // As soon as a post gets uploaded we create a background task. When a background task gets created iOS generates a unique ID and returns it. We store that unique id in the photoUploadTask property. The API requires us to provide an expirationHandler in the form of a closure. That closure runs when the extra time that iOS permitted us has expired. In case the additional background time wasn't sufficient, we are required to cancel our task! Within this block you should delete any temporary resources that you created - in the case of our photo upload we don't have any. Additionally you have to call UIApplication.sharedApplication().endBackgroundTask, otherwise your app will be terminated!
      photoUploadTask = UIApplication.sharedApplication().beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler {
        () -> Void in
        // Within the completion handler of saveInBackgroundWithBlock we inform iOS that our background task is completed. This block gets called as soon as the image upload is finished. The API for background jobs makes us responsible for calling UIApplication.sharedApplication().endBackgroundTask as soon as our work is completed.

    if (image.value == nil) {
      // 2 Here we start the download. Instead of using getData we are using getDataInBackgroundWithBlock - that way we are no longer blocking the main thread!

        if let data = data {
          let image = UIImage(data: data, scale:1.0)!
